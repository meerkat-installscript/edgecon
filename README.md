# Welcome to Edge Conductor !
Edge Conductor is a web-based service designed to provide efficient management and maintenance of deep learning inference models operating at the edge, along with integrated monitoring of inference results.

## Key Features
Edge Conductor enhances performance efficiency in operational environments by monitoring inference situations at the edge and managing training datasets, model training, and deployment. Here are the main features of Edge Conductor:

#### Integrated Edge Monitoring
Centralized monitoring of multiple edges performing inference tasks. It collects a wide range of information, including device information and inference performance scores, from the edges.

#### Training Data Management
To achieve more accurate inference, users can create and manage training datasets. These datasets can be generated from various data sources, such as inference data collected from edges, local PC data, and S3 data. The platform will continually add more data sources according to customer requirements. Additionally, it provides relabeling tools for users to redefine label values in training datasets when the solution supports dataset labeling.

#### Utilization of Diverse Solutions
Users can explore and select from a variety of solutions supported by Mellerikat. Through streams created by these solutions, users can request model training from AI Conductor and manage the deployment of the generated models to the edges.

#### Model Management and Deployment
Users can select training datasets and request updates to models. The performance metrics of the generated models are available for review, and updated models can be deployed to edges to improve inference accuracy.
